# Bike Sharing - Linear Regression Model Assignment
Bike Sharing Linear Regression

### Objective
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

  Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
  How well those variables describe the bike demands

### Business Goal:
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 

This assignment deals with the objective in following steps

## 1) READING AND UNDERSTANDING DATA
## 2) VISUALISE THE DATA
## 3) DATA PREPARTION
## 4) SPLIT THE DATA INTO TEST AND TRAINING DATA
## 5) BUILD AND EVALUATE THE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL

## CONCLUSION

Final model built using RFE with 9 variables achieved adjusted R2 value of 0.823 and p values indicating that features included are all significant, with significance level of 0.05 and VIF score less than 5.
Residual analysis has indicated that error terms are normally distributed and there is a linear relationship between actual and predicted target variable.

Model Evaluation also showed R2 score value of 0.80 which is a good result. We could potentially improve the score by adding more features but the main goal is always to predict as accurately as possible whilst avoiding overfitting.
